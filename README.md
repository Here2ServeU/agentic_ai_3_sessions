# Agentic AI in DevOps: A 3-Session Bootcamp

Welcome to the Agentic AI Bootcamp!  
This is a hands-on program for **complete beginners**.  

You’ll learn how to:
1. Build your first AI agent and troubleshoot Linux systems (Session 1).
2. Use AI for DevSecOps (security) and FinOps (cloud cost savings) (Session 2).
3. Apply AI in Kubernetes for SRE (incident triage and safe fixes) (Session 3).

Each session folder includes:
- A **README.md** explaining scripts line by line.
- Scripts and YAML you can run immediately.

By the end, you’ll understand how to integrate Agentic AI into real-world DevOps workflows.
